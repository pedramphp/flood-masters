						<h2>FIRE, SMOKE &amp; SOOT</h2>
						<aside>
							<p>Fires in the home are not pleasant, even when there are small fires that emit low amounts of smoke level. These fires can still cause unforeseen damage to your home and often times leave a strong odor. Smoke particulates are smaller then the naked eye can see and can invade not only the walls and contents of your home, but the air you breath. Leaving you and your family susceptible to health risks and concerns.</p>
