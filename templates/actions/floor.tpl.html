							<h4>Plush Carpet Details</h4>
							<p style="margin-top:12px">Sink in to the absolute luxury of a plush carpet. Just as its name suggests, a plush carpet is smooth, clean and soft. Plush has been described as a carpet that’s as much of a pleasure to walk on as it is to behold.</p>
							<p>Although a plush carpet is most often used for formal living and dining room settings, it’s also perfect for more private areas, like a bedroom or study. Available in a stunning range of colors. Interior fashion doesn’t get more beautiful or indulgent than this.</p>
							<h4 style="margin-top:50px">Berber Carpet Details</h4>
							<p style="margin-top:12px">Berber’s large and small tufts of fibers make it comfortable under your feet, which makes it excellent for areas of your home that are used frequently. Another advantage of Berber’s loop construction is that it tends to resist crushing more, which can help hide marks from footsteps or vacuuming.</p>
							<p>Berber carpet’s textured look enhances any style of home decoration – from traditional to modern – with a timeless look. It is available in a range of neutral color tones or flecked variations.</p>
