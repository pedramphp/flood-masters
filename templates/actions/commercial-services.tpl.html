						<h2>PARTNER WITH US</h2>
						<aside style="width: 100%;">
							<p>Our partnership programs work in many different ways. The advantages are endless, not only can we establish a face front in your tenants, your facility, and its layout but we can routinely clean and care for your upholstery and carpets leaving a much greater working environment for your tenants. We also will establish an <strong class="red">Emergency Preparation Profile (EPP)</strong> for you once we become partners.</p>
							<p>Our detailed Field Estimators come to your facility and establish a Preparation Profile for you and have a plan of action already set in place for if and when you experience a disaster. Eliminating unforeseen circumstances before we arrive will help minimize cost and work towards your bottom dollar allowing you to minimize business interruption and allowing us effective time to cut on drying and clean up time.</p>
							<ul class="bullet">
								<li>
									<b>Establishing your profile with critical information that is needed only in case of an emergency.</b>
									<span>Emergency exits, water shut off valves, main power supplies.</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Property overview</b>
									<span>Basically a brief biography on the building so we can establish information such as address, detailed directions, what year it was built and any special circumstances to take into account before work begins.</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Multisite Property and Risk Managers</b>
									<span>Whether you oversee one or a multitude of properties, we can individually prepare a plan for each one of your properties allowing you to be steps ahead of the game.</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Identifying the line of command for key decision-making and work authorization.</b>
									<span>This will not only save you time and money but will help us to get started on the work immediately leaving less damage to enter the structure.</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>How to "Get back on your feet."</b>
									<span>This will help with getting you back up and running in a forward direction rather than sitting and spinning your wheels. </span>
