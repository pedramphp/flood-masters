						<h2>Mold Remediation &amp; Removal Services</h2>
						<p>
							Mold contamination continues to affect homes nationwide. Mold has the potential to cause health problems such as lung problems, allergic reaction, or even skin problems. If you have had water damage or rain damage in your home and have not taken care of it within 12-24 hours, there is potential for mold growth within your walls and structure. If not identified and mitigated immediately, it can grow within the walls in your house. Mold can then spread into the HVAC system spreading throughout your home, over time leading to major health and sanitary issues.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our team will assess areas of contamination; analyze what part of your property is affected by the mold. We will also take samples to be tested in the laboratory for identification of the mold type to provide the most specific remediation solution. We will then begin the mitigation of all contaminated materials by removal and then by applying specific solutions to decontaminate and neutralize the affected areas and leave drying equipment to begin the drying process. Once The Flood Masters team has declared the contaminated areas completely dry, we will analyze the area to ensure the entire mold has been removed prior to the rebuilding process. Don’t hesitate, give us a call and let the Masters of Disaster take charge in remedying the mold infestation – <strong class="red">1-855-FLOOD-911</strong>.
